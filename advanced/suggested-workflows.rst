Sharing Work on a Ticket
------------------------

Some tickets require attention from more than one agent
(or even more than one department!).
In these cases, there are three ways to assign the work to the right people:

1. If a ticket is really about two different problems,
   you can :doc:`split it in two </advanced/ticket-actions/split>`,
   then assign each ticket to its respective ‚Äúgroup‚Äù (department).
2. If you‚Äôve done all you can on a ticket
   and it‚Äôs now another agent‚Äôs (or department‚Äôs) responsibility,
   **reassign it** to a new owner (or group).
3. If you just need another agent‚Äôs input on something, you can **@mention** them.
   (And if *you* want to get notifications for *someone else‚Äôs* ticket,
   use the **subscribe button**.)

Reassigning tickets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Reassign a ticket (via the *Group* and *Owner* settings)
   to let colleagues know you‚Äôre done with your part.

Suppose a call comes into the sales department.
A sales rep takes the call, creates a ticket,
and looks up some prices for the customer.
After recording his notes,
the rep then decides that this ticket needs to be passed onto customer service.

Our sales rep can simply un-assign himself has the **owner** of the ticket
and re-assign the ticket to the Customer Service **group**.
*All customer service agents will be notified of the incoming ticket*,
and the first available agent can assign herself
to pick up where the sales rep left off.

.. tip:: Be sure to leave notes with as much information as possible for the next agent!

@mentions & the Subscribe Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now suppose you‚Äôve reassigned the ticket to customer service.
You won‚Äôt receive notifications for this ticket anymore,
but maybe this is a really important contract,
and you want to make sure they have an A+ experience from start to finish.

To enable notifications for a ticket that doesn‚Äôt belong to you,
simply click the **Subscribe** button at the bottom of the ticket pane:

   A list of all tickets you‚Äôre subscribed to
   can be found in the **My mentioned Tickets** overview.

Or, suppose you *don‚Äôt* want to reassign the ticket to customer service‚Äîyou
just have one quick question for them, and then you can take it from there.

To start sending someone else notifications for your own ticket,
type ``@@`` in the message composer and select their name from the pop-up menu:

   @mentioning a colleague in a message
   will automatically subscribe them to your ticket.

.. hint:: ‚öôÔ∏è Check your :doc:`/extras/profile-and-settings` 
   to customize how you receive notifications.

.. note:: üòñ **A colleague @mentioned me, but I don‚Äôt see the ticket!**

   Is the ticket assigned to a group that you don‚Äôt belong to?
   @mentions and subscriptions only work for tickets that you already have access to.
