Issue Trackers
==============

Zammad currently supports GitHub and GitLab both as hosted or self-hosted 
variants. This functionality is currently limited to Issues.

.. note:: **ü§î Huh? I don‚Äôt see ‚ÄúGitHub‚Äù or ‚ÄúGitLab‚Äù in the ticket settings...** 

   | This feature is **optional**; if you don‚Äôt see it in the main menu, 
     that means your administrator hasn‚Äôt enabled it yet. 
   | Administrators can learn more on the admin documentation:
   | `GitHub <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system/integrations/github.html>`_ &
     `GitLab <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system/integrations/gitlab.html>`_

   The GitHub and GitLab tabs within any ticket allow you to keep track on 
   relevant issues to that ticket.

Usage
-----

   .. note::

      Usage for GitHub and GitLab are exact the same. 
      This is why screencasts will show one version, but not both.

Use the tabs |github| and |gitlab| to open the issue sub menu. 
The tab will show a counter with the number of linked issues if applicable.

To link a new issue to the ticket, click on **GitHub ‚ñº** or **GitLab ‚ñº** to 
open the issue dialog. On the new modal provide the issue URL in question and 
press **Submit**.

   .. note:: **‚è≥ Adding new issues may take a moment...**

If you have a ticket opened in the detail view, Zammad will regularly poll the 
linked issues. If the issue changes (e.g. is being closed) Zammad will update 
this state automatically for you.
